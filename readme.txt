## Code Overview

The FLAMES logic involves:
- **Removing common characters**: Simplifies the names to find the total remaining characters.
- **Mapping to the FLAMES acronym**: Determines the relationship based on the remaining character count.

The main functions in the code include:

1. `remove_common_chars(name1, name2)`: Computes the total number of characters left after removing common letters from the two names.
2. `flames_result(remaining_chars)`: Determines the FLAMES relationship using the character count.
3. `flames_relationship(name1, name2)`: Integrates the above functions and maps the result to a descriptive relationship type.

## Example

**Input:**
- Name 1: Alice
- Name 2: Bob

**Output:**
The relationship between **Alice** and **Bob** is: **Lovers** ðŸ’–
